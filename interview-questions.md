# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is local in your machine used in the terminal to push, pull and clone repositories and github is in the cloud use to store code and allowes us to cotribute to that code by making changes.

Researched answer: git is a version control system used fro tracking changes in computer files, git is for code edits and github serves as a location for uploading copies of a git repository.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: includes() returns a boolean value, its basically asking if tt includes something that matches 

Researched answer: the logical OR || operator for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer:arrays index is the position and its value could be a string. ex. ["apple", "orange", "banana"] index of apple is 0, orange is 1 etc.

Researched answer:
The index indicates the position of the element within the array (starting from 1) and is either a number or a field containing a number.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:arrays store sets of data and strings store characters, they both are indexed and count starts at 0.

Researched answer:
Strings are similar to arrays with just a few differences. Usually, the array size is fixed, while strings can have a variable number of elements. Arrays can contain any data type (char short int even other arrays) while strings are usually ASCII characters terminated with a NULL (0) character.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:driver and navigator; driver is the one coding along while the navigator tells the driver what to code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
In Javascript, functions can be assigned to variables in the same way that strings or arrays can. They can be passed into other functions as parameters or returned from them as well. A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

2. Jest: 
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.

3. Objects:
In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc

4. Method:
JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.

5. Classes:
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.
